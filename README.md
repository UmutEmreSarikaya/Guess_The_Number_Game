# Guess_The_Number_Game
This project is a simple number guessing game. The user is provided 5 chances to guess the right number between 1 and 100. The user is guided through texts
like "try a higher number" or "try a lower number". If the user wins the game a green screen appears telling the user won, if not a red screen appears 
telling the loser lost. In both cases the answer is shown and "play again" button appears. 

This project is mainly for learning basics of Android app development with Kotlin. It was done during my internship at OBSS Technology.
